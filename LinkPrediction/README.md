This file contains the code (all interfaces and definitions) for reading the input network, 
analyzing it and generating various static and temporal features for network analysis  over various evolving snapshots of the given network.
The temporal and non temporal features are used to train various machine learning models for predicting new friendships in social networks.
The work is presented in 'Predicting new friendships in Facebook network' by Nanduri et al.

This project makes use of C++ SNAP library v2.3 for network analysis.

Some of the files in the SNAP library have been modified by me to fix bugs. 
(Unfortunately the details were not documented.)
Also this project makes use of Microsoft Office Objects for redirecting output to MS excel sheets.
